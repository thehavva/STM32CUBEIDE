**What is the STM32CUBEIDE?**<br/><br/>

STM32CubeIDE is an advanced C/C++ development platform with peripheral configuration, code generation, code compilation, and debug features for STM32 microcontrollers and microprocessors.
TM32CubeIDE integrates STM32 configuration and project creation functionalities from STM32CubeMX to offer all-in-one tool experience and save installation and development time. After the selection of an empty STM32 MCU or MPU, or preconfigured microcontroller or microprocessor from the selection of a board or the selection of an example, the project is created and initialization code generated. At any time during the development, the user can return to the initialization and configuration of the peripherals or middleware and regenerate the initialization code with no impact on the user code.

STM32CubeIDE includes build and stack analyzers that provide the user with useful information about project status and memory requirements.

STM32CubeIDE also includes standard and advanced debugging features including views of CPU core registers, memories, and peripheral registers, as well as live variable watch, Serial Wire Viewer interface, or fault analyzer.

**WHY SHOULD WE CHOOSE PROTEUS?**<br/><br/>
![Proteus](https://i0.wp.com/www.mekinfo.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ads%C4%B1z67-1.png?resize=1020%2C600&ssl=1)
Proteus is a powerful application built specifically to help designers more easily create and verify the circuit boards they need.It contains advanced electronic circuit elements and libraries. You can find the circuit element you want or another material with the same function and create your circuit and simulation. You can also download and use additional libraries. You can find boards such as microcontroller, communication cards or ardduino. After compiling the communication code of the card you are using, you can transfer it to your circuit via simulation and check whether your code works. Since circuit elements have both schematic and PCB libraries, you can design PCBs with the help of proteus.

Nowadays, buying a microcontroller or a discovery kit is a very expensive business. You will also have to buy the remaining hardware materials. However, you can build the circuit on the simulation, write it through another program and transfer your compiled code to the circuit simulation and see the results. For these reasons I will make examples in the field of hardware design using stm32cubeide and proteus.
In this repository, I will code the stm circuits established with the help of proteus with the help of stm32cubeide.
